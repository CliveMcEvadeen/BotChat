### Repetitive Phrasing

#### Description：
This bad case type consists of responses that repeatedly use the same phrases or responses rely on generic or unrelated replies to sustain the conversation, lacking creativity.

| A         | I missed the TV news last night. What was the lead story on the news? |
| B         | Some actress was in court for driving without a license.              |
| A         | Oh, I see. That's interesting.                                        |
| B         | It's not as interesting as some people think.                         |
| A         | I see.                                                                |

#### Analysis:
In the first example, Speaker B's constant use of "I'm glad" and "You're welcome" creates a lack of creativity. Speaker A's repetitive phrases contribute to the monotony.

In the second example, both speakers engage in repetitive exchanges of pleasantries, like "You're welcome" and "Take care," resulting in unengaging conversations. Repetition hinders meaningful dialogue.
